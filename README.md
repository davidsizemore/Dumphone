Welcome to Dumphone, a fork of [Broke](https://github.com/OzTamir/broke) and [Focus Tap](https://github.com/Walker123t/FocusTap), an open-source alternative to Brick that lets you temporarily dump smartphone features using NFC tags.

### Acknowledgments
Dumphone is an app for tinkerers. If you're interested in additional features and a fully supported experience,  consider purchasing a [Brick](https://getbrick.app/shop).

Dumphone is not available on the app store for download - Oz Tamir created the original project for open-source hobbists.

## Dumphone Features
* Updated, stripped back, and [technu.de](https://technu.de) branded interface
* Open-source, customizable codebase
* Supports multiple profiles
* Allows creating a Dumphone-compatible tags (requires a physical tag)

## Getting Started
To use Dumphone, follow these steps:
* Clone or fork the repository.
* Open the project in Xcode.
* Build and run the app on your iOS device.
* Create one or more Dumphone tags.

## Creating a Dumphone tag
To create a tag, you'll need a physical NFC tag compatible with iOS. Use the Dumphone app interface to turn the NFC tag into a Dumphone tag - it will write a simple phrase that can be detected by the app to turn your block profiles on and off.

Oz Tamir created [a 3D-printable container for holdingNFC tags](https://www.printables.com/model/983618-broke-tag-nfc-tag-cover-with-keychain-and-magnet-h).
